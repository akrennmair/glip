GLIP - GitHub Language Index of Popularity
==========================================

GLIP compares the relative popularity of programming languages by calculating a 
popularity score. Simply speaking, a programming language's popularity score is 
the sum of stars of a programming language's 20 most watched projects on 
GitHub.

This program scrapes GitHub (there's not API for that kind of stuff, yet) for 
that information and generates a table for comparison.
